I'm a Principal Developer at Itty Bitty Apps specialising in Android app development.  I'm passionate about building inclusive, diverse and high performing teams.  Great things happen when you empower developers to be their very best.

I also speak on Android related subjects, both at developer meetups in Australia and internationally, as well as at various conferences.

I speak a bit of Mandarin, Sail, Hike, Cook and parent my two awesome kids.   A lover of cakes shaped like animals of the Chinese zodiac and of tea.
